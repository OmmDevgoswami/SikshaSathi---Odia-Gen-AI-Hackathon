## Inspiration
After a lot of brainstorming, we wanted a tool that could help solve a real life problem and help students preparing for various competative exam's such as JEE, NEET, UPSC and even basic important exams such as Class 10 and Class 12 in their own local language.

## What it does
It provides students with proper gudiance and a structure to follow on how to prepare and excel various competative exams.
It helps students in their preparation with:
- Prepare and Follow a dedicated roadmap for their exam preparation
- Practice various topic wise questions for better preparation
- Have your doubt's cleared in your own comfort local language
